## About 

:sunglasses:  Hi, I’m @jazlynhellman, a 24 year-old woman from New York currently living in Montreal, Quebec.

I’m a second year Master's student at McGill University conducting research at the intersection of HCI and software engineering under the supervision of Prof. Jin L.C. Guo
and co-supervision of Prof. Jinghui Cheng. 

:scroll: My thesis is on open-source software usability and participatory design through analyzing power structures between key stakeholders.

I have a B.A. in Software Engineering and International Development with minors in Social Entrepreneurship and Arabic language. I’m interested in HCI and AI research to understand what design considerations should be made when creating systems that provide solutions for various types social issues. In the past I have worked in NGOs and companies tackling refugee rights and advocacy, support for individuals with special needs, educational and financial support to individuals who have lost both their parents in Japan and Sub-Saharan Africa, and more. I'm always looking for new opportunities to do some good in the world!
