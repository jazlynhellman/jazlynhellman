ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jazlynhellman, an avid reader, oil-painter, cyclist, and traveler from Upstate NY, US currently living in Montreal.

Iâ€™m a second year Master's student at McGill University conducting research at the intersection of HCI and software engineering under the supervision of Prof. Jin L.C. Guo
and co-supervision of Prof. Jinghui Cheng. 

My thesis is on open-source software usability and participatory design through analyzing power structures between key stakeholders.

Iâ€™m interested in HC-AI and conducting ethical design to create systems that can create innovative solutions for social issues.
